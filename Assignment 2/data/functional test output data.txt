To test that the algorithm was correctly implemented a number of tests were performed. The code and the result can be seen in appendix___. The result of the tests is:
 
Test 1, Testing an array with 1 element. It shows that the algorithm won't compare it, and returns dmin = numeric_limits<int>::max();.
{1}
Min distance1: 2147483647 Basic operations: 1
Min distance2: 2147483647 Basic operations: 0
 
Test 2, Testing an array of 2 elements. The results are as expected and the MinDisitance2 algorithm compares the pair only once.
{1,2}
Min distance1: 1 Basic operations: 4
Min distance2: 1 Basic operations: 1
 
Test 3, Testing an array of 3 elements.
{1, 2, 4}
Min distance1: 1 Basic operations: 9
Min distance2: 1 Basic operations: 3
 
Test 4, Testing an array of 5 elements.
{1,3,6,9,22}
Min distance1: 2 Basic operations: 25
Min distance2: 2 Basic operations: 10
 
Test 5, Testing an array of 5 elements with the same value.
{3,3,3,3,3}
Min distance1: 0 Basic operations: 25
Min distance2: 0 Basic operations: 10
 
Test 6, Testing an empty array, None of the algorithm runs, and returns dmin = numeric_limits<int>::max();.
{}
Min distance1: 2147483647 Basic operations: 0
Min distance2: 2147483647 Basic operations: 0
 
Test 7, Testing an array of 12 elements, descending.
{100,90,80,70,60,55,50,40,30,20,10,0}
Min distance1: 5 Basic operations: 177
Min distance2: 5 Basic operations: 99
